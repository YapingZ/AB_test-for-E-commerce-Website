##                                         AB Test for E-commerce website

### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Main idea

The most difficult part for A/B test is to define the problem clearly and find the feature that really import to your goal. Then try to figure out the relationship of these figures and how they work together to get the conclusion. 

Something you should think of include:

1)What features we should choose from these dataset

2)How long shall we run to get the data

3)When should we decide to stop the experiment
